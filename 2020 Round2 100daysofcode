Decided to re-start my 100daysofcode challenge back to day 1 because of too many missed days of coding last december. 
I also continued the tutorial series that I'm working on about Web Development for Total beginners. 
I also incorporated the freecodecamp challenges while building the travel blog in my tutorial for me to also get to review my lessons.

making tutorial videos related to how I'm building the site. I'm also looking 
into applying for a remote job as a web developer. I just want to ask for advice if its ok
if I just start with a $6 per hour rate. I'm willing to start with that rate per hour and just want
to get the necessary experience to further improve my skills. Any advice would be highly appreciated.

Continued with the short course in Scrimba, 
I'm also working on improving the design for my personal free tutorial wordpress site. 
Found out about the WCAG 2.0 contrast Guidelines. https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/ also 
found out about contrast checking tools and I'm going to check out how to use them. 
Learned the rule about contrast ratio should be at least 4.5:1 at the least.  
Contrast is important for accessibility. 
We'll take a look at the WCAG 2.0 contrast Guidelines.
Contrast is defined as being in a "strikingly" different state from something else.
Scale just as with alignment, white space, contrast, and the other fundamentals, 
the size of every UI element must be carefully considered.
Define you, Destroy you or strengthen you

#Day 8 Feb 5, 2020
Reviewed some of my lessons in javascript from Bob Tabor and remembered that I can use the www.//caniuse.com to check features of javascript which shows us about the description and current version on whether it is supported or not. Also checked out babeljs.io which use the combination of techniques that takes your code and see how it converts it to old versions.Added these to my resources. Been working on reviewing my knowledge in javascript. Always agreed with Bob about writing code that its fun and encouraging.

#Day 9 Feb 6 2020
Followed through the snake game of Sir Chris De Leon and it's amazing how he can make a game 
within that 4 minutes video. Really interested in taking his course for game dev. Just need
to find funds. Now I just need to study how the code worked. 
Applied some Css to center the game and added some colors to the background.
