Contrast is defined as being in a "strikingly" different state from something else.
Scale just as with alignment, white space, contrast, and the other fundamentals, 
the size of every UI element must be carefully considered.

Still working on the positioning of the elements and images, need to work on responsiveness. 
Applied some simple animation for the buttons in the navigation area. Also worked on creating a grid layout configuration. Saw a job post with requirements of learning elastic search. Trying to do some reading about it and researching about what Timber is about. Reviewed how to create grid format using float and clearfix.

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2OlICtlqTzf-bvY--cedCcjIUg7PAE29TRb5gq601bRsUsw/viewform


Used max-width which helps in specifiying the width that we specified if we have enough width but if the viewport is smaller it will simply fill 100% of the available space. 


Margin: 0 auto is the trick to center block elements inside of annother block elements.
This works when we say that we want the margin to render automatically, this means that the browser whgen rendering the page will automatically figure out rendering the margin on the left and the right side. Since its both set to auto, it means that left and right will be the same. 

Since CSS will automatically calculate the left and right margin so that they will be the same so of course the element will be centered. 

Learned about the calc() function and how it can be used to mix units inside of that functions.

select start ^ 
Select any class that ends $
select all * that contains

ToString > is already something that objects already have. We need to have it with a public override because objects already have it for free.

We want to do our own version. NOw we want to convert a json representation of a product. 

Serialize is taking all the object information and then converting it back to the text that will be part of the Json. Serial means to do something one after the other. 



public override ToString()

Today I'm reviewing how Cascade works.Reviewed how the !important declaration and specificity works. 
Understanding the cascading values. Changed all absolute px units to relative rem units.

Comm Plan.

Net Name - COVID Watch Net

Pri Freq - 3.996Mhz LSB
Sec Freq - 3.993Mhz LSB (down 3Khz)**
Alt Freq - 3.990Mhz LSB (down 3Khz)**
Start time - 0100Z Sat 21 Mar (20 Mar Fri 2000 CDT)

All stations be prepared to relay. Any station able to relay must be in
contact with NCS or Alt NCS. As 75m is more a regional band and the
noise floor can be significant use of amplifiers is desired.

**Net Control Station (NCS) moves to Sec Freq if Pri freq is
occupied or splatter is occurring at the NCS location. In the event the
Sec freq is occupied or is unworkable continue down to Alt frequency. If
Sec freq is used start time will be 2005z and if conditions require the
Alt freq use then start time will be 2010z. With the crowded nature of
75m band don't forget, minor adjustments in operating freq may be
required based on usage by other operators or nets.

End of Comm Plan.


#Day 44
#100DaysOfCode #R2D44 March 21 2020

Today I created another tutorial in one of the project that I'm building. 
Also checked an article about value pricing your work. Trying to find a remote work &
found one job asking how much would a landing page usually cost. Trying to also refactor some of 
my projects to use rem instead of px.

BLOCK standalone component that is meaningful on its own.

ELEMENT is a part of a block that has no standalone meaning. If we take out this elements inside of the block they wouldn't have any meaning or they won't be useful. Example recipe block then recipe__info which is mainly just for the recipe information.

Take note that the recipe block still appears within all the class names within the block. 

We can also see that we have very low specificity ledgers. We always use classes and they are never nested. This is why they have a very low specifity which is why BEM is widely used for easy to maintain code. 

MODIFIER is a flag that we can put on a block or element in order to make it different from the regular blocks or elements or version. 

For instance there maybe some rules for buttons and we used the modifier to make a more specific and different button and in our example a round one. 




Naming approaches in naming classes. This are standalone components that can be used anywhere in the project

Absolute lengths are self-regulating and they don't base their dimensions on anything else on the page. They don't base it on parent element or another font. They base it on real world measurements which are great for use in printing.
Inches (in)
Centimeters (cm)
Millimeters (mm)
point and picas
Points (pt) -these are typographic terms in your document is the physical measurement. We are talking about physical dimensions of a printed example.
Picas (pc) a point in picas is 12 pts
Pixels is what we've been using and a lot are familiar with this absolute unit. Eventhough they are absolute units they are not based on the viewport width or another elements font-size. They are best thought as device pixels
 because the size of the pixels can vary depending on the device. If you have a high density device such as a cellphone screen or a low density monitor. You will find the idea of pixels on all devices. You would see that other lengths map directly to pixels. You will notice that when you inspect an element they get rendered in pixel. Javascript is rendered in pixel. This is why it is the most commonly used css units.

Relative lentghts gets their measurements from something else
The parents dimensions(%)
The currently Declared font-attribute(em,rem,ex,ch)
The viewport dimension(vw,vh,vmin,vmax)
Percentages(%)
Font-sizes(em&rem)
Viewport Dimension (vw&vh)
Viewport Max(vmax)
Viewport Min(vmin)

#lf{
  position: static;
  background-color: lightblue;
}

when we position something statically it stays within the normal flow of the document.

Even if we change the top property.  It will not move. It still stays within the normal flow of the document. Top, left, right, bottom properties will still stay the same way and don't do anything at all. 

When we change the position property to relative.
You would see that nothing happens. With relative positioning you can move the element but it moves from where it would naturally would flow within the normal flow of the document. The box stays from where it is.

But if we set the properties you can see that the box drops 20px from the top of the normal flow.

ABSOLUTE:
Now you can see that the other words after the box moves over to the left and we can see that the box gets burried within. 
Whats happening here is that when use the absolute property. It gets remove completely from the normal flow. 

You can see that the rest of the document or the part which is in the normal flow assumes that it is not even there. You can see that the box gets completly remove from the normal flow.

When we position it using top20px you would see that it positions itself from the top of the normal flow of the document.
If we give it a top: 0px and left 0px; we can see that it is up in the left corner of our document. 

IF we use relative we can see that its still exactly the same as if it is statically positioned. So for the relative positioning the rest of the document in that flow makes room for the element. While with absolute it completely gets remove from the flow and the room for it is remove as well and the rest of the flow adjust accordingly. 

NORMAL FLOW - static positining default elements remian within the normal flow
ABSOLUTE POSITIONING: Elements are removed from the normal flow and positioned from the topleft of current context and other elements adjust accordingly.
RELATIVE POSITIONING- elements removed from the normal flow positioned from the would be normal flow position and other elements will maintain their position.

#Day 64
#100DaysOfCode #R2Day64 May 9 2020 
Applied BEM in header-section and section-cards and trying to implement SCSS in the rental project that I'm working
on. Reviewed how to make multiple lines of code into a mixin and call it using @include. Reviewed the DRY principle 
don't repeat yourself. Also used arguments in @mixins.In a mixin the code is copied to the selector
In an %extend the selector is the one copied to the code.

Mixins reusable piece of code that we write into a mixin.
Whenever we use that mixin, that code is put in a place, where we used or called that mixin. Its like a huge 
variable that has multiple lines of codes. 

Lets imagine that we wanted to use the clearfix not only in the navigation but in multiple places. It would
be more practical to create a mixin in place of the clearfix code that we have which is composed of multiple lines. 

We can pass in an argument in a mixin
Extends allows us to place a placeholder and put a bunch of styles and have other selectors extend that placeholder.

placeholder using the percentage sign. 
In a mixin the code is copied to the selector
In an extend the selector is the one copied to the code. We only use extend when the rules that we are extending are inherently and
thematically inherent.

Able to review how to perform npm init to install package.json file.
npm install node-sass and also install jquery. Also read about website legal requirements for privacy policies. 

This will make sure that the package.json file is updated and list this package as one of  our developer dependencies. It means that node sass is a tool that we used to develp our project 

npm install node-sass --save-dev

We can now see that node sass is listed as a dev dependency

we can also use jquerry

npm install jquery - we don't need to put --save-dev because jquery is not a tool for development. Its a javascript file that we want to include in our project. 

npm install jquery --save
this will create a field for dependencies, this is what we need in our project. It helps with the functions. While in node sass its just a tool.

npm uninstall jquery --save
to uninstall

we can delete the node_modules folder when we try to upload our files, because we already have our devDependencies in our package.json file. 

Then we can just go and perform
>npm install

Also worked on RBSrental project and applied mediaquerries on the header-section.



Object relational mapping. I also look into Flask SQLAlchemy. I have a project in mind that I
want to implement and I'm going to use python for fulfilling this project. 


Object Oriented Programming
Class (Flight is an example)
 	We can define properties inside of the class.
	Method - is more on behavior, we can also define methods in side of our classes.

SQL Database lets us perform querries. This is a separate world from where we can 

Object Relational Mapping can allow us to tie Python classes, methods, and object to interact with databases.

FLASK SQLAlchemy.

 Did a 1 hour flask tutorial in Freecodecamp. Learned a different 
 method in installing flasks and a virtual environment. Was able to 
 install flasks now wondering how to install flask-sqlalchemy. I'm wondering how flasks is similar to Yarn and PHP? 


PRETTY Printed tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjtW-wnXlUY

#import flask we just need to type from flask import Flask with a capital F
from flask import Flask


>py -m venv env
Create a file in the flask app directory
This is the main app file. Set an environment variable in our command prompt.
#we use the command set FLASK_APP(this has to be in all caps) equal to the name of the file that you've created. 
>set FLASK_APP=app.py
#This will allow flask to know what file to look for when we try to run it. 

#the small case flask is the library and the uppercase Flask command is the class for Flask and 

from flask import Flask

#we want to instantiate that class. By convention we use the following command. This is referencing the name of the current module that you are working in. That is currenlty the app.py file that we just created. 
>app = Flask(__name__)


#This is the name of the route URL endpointfor a particular thing in the app. We can put anything that we want here ('/hello') ('/files') ('/profile'), whatever we want we can also leave it as a slash. 
#we can then give this function a name, the name can be whatever we want. We can name it something that is descriptive. In this case this is the index which means that this is the base URL for whatever the site is. def index():
>@app.route('/') # this is the decorator, once we go to slash / we can access the 		 # function that is going to run
>  def index():  # this is a function
>    return '<h1>Hell!</h1>':  # this is a return statement, this is returning directly 				#to the browser and since this is html the browser will 				#render it as html and it will show it to you. 



#add a placeholder inside of the parentheses in our decorator. Any placeholder in the endpoint. We need to have in our function as a parameter. 


@app.route('/name')
def index(name):
  return '<h1>HELLO {}!</h1>'.format(name) #We can then put that name parameter inside of 					   #our html.
					   # We can use the curly brackets as place 					   #holders.


# We can see that it will not run because of the endpoint no longer existing because we now have our placeholder. We need to pass in something inside of the URL so that flasks will read it for us

 Installed Lint in my visual studio code, I was able to run 
 the layout.html in flasks, now I'm wondering if I can combine node-sass 
 and flasks and on whether it will work on github pages? Will the app.py 
 that I've created work in github pages? The templates folder should contain 
 the html files, I'm wondering if i should also transfer the differnet folders 
 like my css folders and image files in the same templates folder.

Working on the Database for the signup form that I've made and read about collation. 
https://database.guide/what-is-collation-in-databases/

CREATE TABLE users (
	user_id int(11) not null AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
	user_fname varchar(256) not null,
	user_lname varchar(256) not null,
	user_email varchar(256) not null,
	user_userId varchar(256) not null,
	user_pwd varchar(256) not null

);


int(11) number means that we can have 11 characters inside the user_id column. This means we can have 
999999 up to 11 charactesr which is quite a lot of users inside of the website.

not null just basically means that it cannot be set to null or nothing. It is not the same as having an empty field inside of a table. 
It just means that the data cannot be null. 

AUTO_INCREMENT each time a new piece of data is inserted inside the user table we are going to increase the integer by 1 automatically. 

The first user once they sign up inside of the webiste is going to have a user id set to 1 then when another user sign up his user id will be 2 and so on.

Its going to automatically increase the id.

We need to set the user_id into the PRIMARY KEY
This allows us to have a unique number that will be identifying the unique id for this table. 



IN the next line will 
varchar(256) this means that there will be at least 256 characters.
