Continued with the short course in Scrimba, 
I'm also working on improving the design for my personal free tutorial wordpress site. 
Found out about the WCAG 2.0 contrast Guidelines. https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/ also 
found out about contrast checking tools and I'm going to check out how to use them. 
Learned the rule about contrast ratio should be at least 4.5:1 at the least.  
Contrast is important for accessibility. 
We'll take a look at the WCAG 2.0 contrast Guidelines.
Contrast is defined as being in a "strikingly" different state from something else.
Scale just as with alignment, white space, contrast, and the other fundamentals, 
the size of every UI element must be carefully considered.
Define you, Destroy you or strengthen you
