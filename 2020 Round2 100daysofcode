#100daysofcode Round2 Day 1 Jan 29, 2020
Decided to re-start my 100daysofcode challenge back to day 1 because of too many missed days of coding last december. 
I also continued the tutorial series that I'm working on about Web Development for Total beginners. 
I also incorporated the freecodecamp challenges while building the travel blog in my tutorial for me to also get to review my lessons.

#Day 3 January 31, 2020
Today I just worked on the travel website that I'm making and continued on 
making tutorial videos related to how I'm building the site. I'm also looking 
into applying for a remote job as a web developer. I just want to ask for advice if its ok
if I just start with a $6 per hour rate. I'm willing to start with that rate per hour and just want
to get the necessary experience to further improve my skills. Any advice would be highly appreciated.
