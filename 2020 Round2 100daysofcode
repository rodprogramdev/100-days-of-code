#100daysofcode Round2 Day 1 Jan 29, 2020
Decided to re-start my 100daysofcode challenge back to day 1 because of too many missed days of coding last december. 
I also continued the tutorial series that I'm working on about Web Development for Total beginners. 
I also incorporated the freecodecamp challenges while building the travel blog in my tutorial for me to also get to review my lessons.
