# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 1, 2018
#####

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed the 100daysofCode challenge rules and created a new Github account and Freecodecamp account to restart from the very beginning of the challenge.

**Thoughts: I learned today that online courses are not included in the #100dayscode Challenge so I'll need to work on finishing my Udemy Course but not include the number of hours that I commit to it in the challenge and alot building a static website that I can use for my Photography business. I'm thinking either the Photography business or will I be working on a CyberCafe Business or better I can check out making a website for my sisters business.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
