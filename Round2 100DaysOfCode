#Day 0: AUGUST 3, 2019
Progress: I wrote an article in my freetutorial site https://rbslfreetutorial.wordpress.com/2019/08/03/100-days-of-code-achievement/ and 
I've decided to continue with my FCC Landing page and try to reverse engineer the challenge due to one of the jobs that I've tried to apply
asked on whether I can create a website out of a pdf file format. 

#Day 1: AUGUST 4, 2019
Progress: Today I learned that Hostgator can be access through personal billing information of the owner and ccpanel for developers. 
I am also currently working on the FCC challenge and I can't seem to be able to make the Font-Awesome work and read about some CSS selectors

#Day 2: AUGUST 5, 2019
Progress:I was able to fix the header position and fixed the navbar together with the header logo. I also placed the font-awesome 
icon cdn on the head element and it finally worked. Having problems with with fixed header overlapping while scrolling. The btn seems to
be not adapting the color i've set only except when hovered.

#Day 3: AUGUST 6, 2019
Progress: 
Already accomplish the user stories from the fcc challenge, now working on responsiveness and aesthetics and still 
troubleshooting the concern with the header and found out that it was a mere issue of vw width, Also worked on the 
btn color and I made a mistake with the css selector that was why the original color was not working when the mouse 
was not hovering.Also worked on the Pricing section and footer section. Still continuing with reverse engineering the landing page and
trying to recreate the page. Still needs some work with media querries, property positioning and responsiveness.

#Day 4: AUGUST 7, 2019
Progress:
Currently working on the media querries at max-width 650px of the header area, trying to find out how arrange the rows of the nav-bar. 
There is also an issue with the logo not scrolling down.

#Day 5: AUGUST 8, 2019 
Progress: Worked on the alignment of the section features,was able to fix and align the icons properly. I learned that you
can use a different flex-direction for media querries to re-arrange the nav ul elements into a column. 
Trying to find out how to arrange them into a center position when resized.
