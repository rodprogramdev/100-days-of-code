The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [AUGUST 3, SATURDAY, 2019].

Log
#Day 0: AUGUST 3, 2019
Progress: I wrote an article in my freetutorial site https://rbslfreetutorial.wordpress.com/2019/08/03/100-days-of-code-achievement/ and 
I've decided to continue with my FCC Landing page and try to reverse engineer the challenge due to one of the jobs that I've tried to apply
asked on whether I can create a website out of a pdf file format. 

#Day 1: AUGUST 4, 2019
Progress: Today I learned that Hostgator can be access through personal billing information of the owner and ccpanel for developers. 
I am also currently working on the FCC challenge and I can't seem to be able to make the Font-Awesome work and read about some CSS selectors
Link:https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/setup/getting-started
https://techbrij.com/css-selector-adjacent-child-sibling.

#Day 2: AUGUST 5, 2019
Progress:I was able to fix the header position and fixed the navbar together with the header logo. I also placed the font-awesome 
icon cdn on the head element and it finally worked. Having problems with with fixed header overlapping while scrolling. The btn seems to
be not adapting the color i've set only except when hovered.

#Day 3: AUGUST 6, 2019
Progress: 
Already accomplish the user stories from the fcc challenge, now working on responsiveness and aesthetics and still 
troubleshooting the concern with the header and found out that it was a mere issue of vw width, Also worked on the 
btn color and I made a mistake with the css selector that was why the original color was not working when the mouse 
was not hovering.Also worked on the Pricing section and footer section. Still continuing with reverse engineering the landing page and
trying to recreate the page. Still needs some work with media querries, property positioning and responsiveness.

#Day 4: AUGUST 7, 2019
Progress:
Currently working on the media querries at max-width 650px of the header area, trying to find out how arrange the rows of the nav-bar. 
There is also an issue with the logo not scrolling down.

#Day 5: AUGUST 8, 2019 
Progress: Worked on the alignment of the section features,was able to fix and align the icons properly. I learned that you
can use a different flex-direction for media querries to re-arrange the nav ul elements into a column. 
Trying to find out how to arrange them into a center position when resized.

#Day 6: AUGUST 9, 2019 
Progress: 
Currently worked on the footer section, was able to arrange the margin when resized and
applied media queries at max-width 600px. Also fixed the boxes into a column once 
resized. Trying to figure out how to place into the center the text inside of the cards.
I'm thinking about adding some more media querries for different screen sizes besides
max-width 800px and max-width 650px for more responsiveness option for different
screen devices.

#Day 7: AUGUST 10, 2019 
Progress: I Can't seem to figure out why a scroll bar is appearing in the footer when I resize it the page.
I was able to solve the issue on centering the text in the product section by applying float:none property. 
I also watched youtube videos about APIs and trying to figure out on how to 
use them. Also looked into a json crash course by traversy media.
I did some editing in the computation of the student excel automatic gradesheet 
I made.

#Day 8: AUGUST 11, 2019 
Progress:
Still working on finding out about the issue of the scroll bar coming out when 
I resize the page using media querries. Playing around with the header section media querries and 
apply some breakpoints for different screen sizes. I also reviewed  basic git commands to practice pushing
files into a remote repository in github. Also started the boiler plate html files of the tech documentation 
project in FreeCodeCamp.

#Day 9: AUGUST 12, 2019 
Progress:
Today I started to do semantics with the technical documentation project in Free Code Camp. Working on  fulfilling the user stories set
in the challenge. Planning to use bootstrap in making the project and apply the SCSS preprocessor to review concept on how to use SASS.

#Day 10: AUGUST 13, 2019 
Progress: Still working on the technical documentation. Working on fulfilling the User stories and validated the semantics. 
Read about agile and scrum for product development. Read some articles about full-stack, front-end, and a back-end developer. 
So that I would be more familiarize with what track I shouldtake and learn to master some of the skills needed for each of those roles.

#Day 11: AUGUST 14, 2019 
Progress: 
Still working on completing the technical documentation but also did a side project for making CSS loaders. found a great free tutorial 
from traversy media in youtube. Learned tha you can actually use "loremValue" to generate automatic lorem ipsum text.
I also learned how to do a fade in effect using
javaScript.

#Day 12: AUGUST 15, 2019 
Progress: I've been playing around with animation of the technical documentation project. I also reviewed concepts of the 
BEM model, hoping to understand how I could further apply it to my projects. Looking into one of my previous project and
trying to find out how I can improve some of the glitches in the project.

#Day 13: AUGUST 16, 2019 
Progress:
Reviewed how to use bootstrap 4, found issues with extra white space, and found out that it's coming from the property top of my 
nav class. I've been playing around with the navbar and experiencing a lot of trial and error, trying to 
figure out how to fix it on the side for the user stories layout. watch REST APIs tutorials on youtube. 

#Day 14: August 17, 2019
Progress:
-Had plenty of work at school so doing some multitasking by watching and listening to a tutorial 
on how to make a tetris game with react js.

-Still working on the technical documentation project and found out 
that it was the simple ! that was causing me to fail the user story, 
Finally able to complete the semantics and user stories
requirements.

-Still working on understanding how APIs work. 
I'm also wondering about testing your
website in different browsers. So far I've only used chrome and
would like to be familiarize with the different browsers
from where you can test your website. 

-Doing some reading about the  
concrete definition of the difference between a website and a 
webapp.

-Trying to do some tweaks to one of my old project. Still
need to design a logo and adjust some of the colors plus some 
some parts such as the footer and the pop
up window I would still need to adjust some of the layout.
Wondering what does this security vulnerabilities mean in 
my dependencies going to need to read more about them. 

Planning to recreate this from scratch so that I could
remember and retain how I made it using SASS and use of the BEM 
methodology of naming classes. 


#Day 15: August 18, 2019
Progress:
Today I added some of the content of the JavaScript Technical
Documentation project I'm working on.

I did some tweaks with the old project card properties. Increased
the perspective from 20rem to 40rem to make the transition flip
of the card look more natural. Still need to think of a more suitable 
color for the spiderman theme that I want to achieve. Comments would be 
highly appreciated. 

#Day 16: August 19, 2019
Progress:
Reviewed difference between var, let, and const keywords.
ES6(ES2015): difference between a block scope variable and a function scope variable.
While working on the technical documentation and reading throught some of the materials.

#Day 17: August 21, 2019
Wondering how to combine this images same with how coderadio was 
able to do it. Working on placing it in my Technical documentation
project. Finally done with the content, now going to work on 
semantics and aesthetics of the project. Today I also saw 
job for front-end I also tried applying by sending my resume. Hoping 
to get a chance for the interview so that i can have more experience
in interviews related to front-end development.

#Day 18: August 22, 2019
Progress: 
Worked on the technical docs and slowly moving forward and Reviewing the commands in git had problems with merging
from another branch to the master branch. Practiced the basic commands so that I can use git more often in my future projects. 
Also checked out github pages theme section. Watch Popsql and Mysql tutorials.installed mysql in my local computer.

PRIMARY Key
Surrogate Key
Natural Key
Foreign Key
	super_id (supervisor id)
	manager_id
Composite key - key needs two 
attributes. 
Supplier name doesn't uniquely
identify to each row.
The branch id doesn't uniquely
identify to each row.

They don't uniquely
identify to each row only 
together can they uniquely identify
to each row.

Only the combination of
branch and supplier is the
one that identifies a row.

Composites id that 
are foreign keys that makes 
up a primary key
which is a very useful way
to define a relationship
like how much  product has 
been bought by a client from
an employee.

The more complex are or your 
database schema.

Being able to use 
foreign keys in order to 
define different
relationships

Querries
set of instruction given to RDBMS

SQL BASICS
Language used for interacting
with Relational Database
Management.

Its not technically a 
programming language
but it can be used to give
instruction to RDBMS.


RDBMS is a piece of software that 
you can use to communicate with
a relational database.

You can use RDBMS to create
a database for an application
that you are building.

RDBMS can help ensure that you
store everything and structure it
the way you want it to be stored.


You will need to speak
to RDBMS with a language and that 
is not English. It does speak
the language called sql.

If we want to ask RDBMS to 
do something for us like
store a piece of information
create a table retrieve, or 
delete a content of the database.

SQL is four
different language
SQL is a hybrid language

Data Query language (DQL)
Data Definition Language(DDL)
Data Control Language(DCL)
Data Manipulation Language(DML)

SCRUM
SQL

Wath a version control is?

Standard task 

YOUR DAILY TASKS
Create things
Save things
Edit things
Save the thing again

Version control helps you
in the saving process
to identify when you did it,
why you did it and 
what the contents of the
change were open for review
anytime in the future.

You can describe
what the contents of the 
change were.

Change of a color
or adding a company logo.

For a single individual
It wont be difficult.

Time and versions.
Collaborative history tracking
Keeping track who change
it
when they change it
why they change it.

This actions of you and the team working. 
This is handled by a full pledge version system.

It can be during the same time with your team.
using the concept of merge.

Git is a fst and moerd implementation of version control. Very lightwieght and extremely fast
It provides you history of content changes. Can give you history of all the files 
that compose a project. Graphics design, and even programming code.
Git facilitates collaboragtive to files simulataneiously and then brigning them together for unified effect.

Git is easy to use for any type of knowledge worker. Equally serves designers and not only programmers.
