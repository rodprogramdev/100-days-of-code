Log
#Day 0: AUGUST 3, 2019
Progress: I wrote an article in my freetutorial site https://rbslfreetutorial.wordpress.com/2019/08/03/100-days-of-code-achievement/ and 
I've decided to continue with my FCC Landing page and try to reverse engineer the challenge due to one of the jobs that I've tried to apply
asked on whether I can create a website out of a pdf file format. 

#Day 1: AUGUST 4, 2019
Progress: Today I learned that Hostgator can be access through personal billing information of the owner and ccpanel for developers. 
I am also currently working on the FCC challenge and I can't seem to be able to make the Font-Awesome work and read about some CSS selectors

#Day 2: AUGUST 5, 2019
Progress:I was able to fix the header position and fixed the navbar together with the header logo. I also placed the font-awesome 
icon cdn on the head element and it finally worked. Having problems with with fixed header overlapping while scrolling. The btn seems to
be not adapting the color i've set only except when hovered.

#Day 3: AUGUST 6, 2019
Progress: 
Already accomplish the user stories from the fcc challenge, now working on responsiveness and aesthetics and still 
troubleshooting the concern with the header and found out that it was a mere issue of vw width, Also worked on the 
btn color and I made a mistake with the css selector that was why the original color was not working when the mouse 
was not hovering.Also worked on the Pricing section and footer section. Still continuing with reverse engineering the landing page and
trying to recreate the page. Still needs some work with media querries, property positioning and responsiveness.

#Day 4: AUGUST 7, 2019
Progress:
Currently working on the media querries at max-width 650px of the header area, trying to find out how arrange the rows of the nav-bar. 
There is also an issue with the logo not scrolling down.

#Day 5: AUGUST 8, 2019 
Progress: Worked on the alignment of the section features,was able to fix and align the icons properly. I learned that you
can use a different flex-direction for media querries to re-arrange the nav ul elements into a column. 
Trying to find out how to arrange them into a center position when resized.

#Day 6: AUGUST 9, 2019 
Progress: 
Currently worked on the footer section, was able to arrange the margin when resized and
applied media queries at max-width 600px. Also fixed the boxes into a column once 
resized. Trying to figure out how to place into the center the text inside of the cards.
I'm thinking about adding some more media querries for different screen sizes besides
max-width 800px and max-width 650px for more responsiveness option for different
screen devices.

#Day 7: AUGUST 10, 2019 
Progress: I Can't seem to figure out why a scroll bar is appearing in the footer when I resize it the page.
I was able to solve the issue on centering the text in the product section by applying float:none property. 
I also watched youtube videos about APIs and trying to figure out on how to 
use them. Also looked into a json crash course by traversy media.
I did some editing in the computation of the student excel automatic gradesheet 
I made.

Progress:
Still working on finding out about the issue of the scroll bar coming out when 
I resize the page using media querries. Playing around with the header section media querries and 
apply some breakpoints for different screen sizes. I also reviewed  basic git commands to practice pushing
files into a remote repository in github. Also started the boiler plate html files of the tech documentation 
project in FreeCodeCamp.

#Day 9: AUGUST 12, 2019 
Progress:
Today I started to do semantics with the technical documentation project in Free Code Camp. Working on  fulfilling the user stories set
in the challenge. Planning to use bootstrap in making the project and apply the SCSS preprocessor to review concept on how to use SASS.

#Day 10: AUGUST 13, 2019 
Progress: Still working on the technical documentation. Working on fulfilling the User stories and validated the semantics. 
Read about agile and scrum for product development. Read some articles about full-stack, front-end, and a back-end developer. 
So that I would be more familiarize with what track I shouldtake and learn to master some of the skills needed for each of those roles.

#Day 11: AUGUST 14, 2019 
Progress: 
Still working on completing the technical documentation but also did a side project for making CSS loaders. found a great free tutorial 
from traversy media in youtube. Learned tha you can actually use "loremValue" to generate automatic lorem ipsum text.
I also learned how to do a fade in effect using
javaScript.

#Day 12: AUGUST 15, 2019 
Progress: I've been playing around with animation of the technical documentation project. I also reviewed concepts of the 
BEM model, hoping to understand how I could further apply it to my projects. Looking into one of my previous project and
trying to find out how I can improve some of the glitches in the project.

#Day 13: AUGUST 16, 2019 
Progress:
Reviewed how to use bootstrap 4, found issues with extra white space, and found out that it's coming from the property top of my 
nav class. I've been playing around with the navbar and experiencing a lot of trial and error, trying to 
figure out how to fix it on the side for the user stories layout. watch REST APIs tutorials on youtube. 

#Day 14: August 17, 2019
Progress:
-Had plenty of work at school so doing some multitasking by watching and listening to a tutorial 
on how to make a tetris game with react js.

-Still working on the technical documentation project and found out 
that it was the simple ! that was causing me to fail the user story, 
Finally able to complete the semantics and user stories
requirements.

-Still working on understanding how APIs work. 
I'm also wondering about testing your
website in different browsers. So far I've only used chrome and
would like to be familiarize with the different browsers
from where you can test your website. 

-Doing some reading about the  
concrete definition of the difference between a website and a 
webapp.

-Trying to do some tweaks to one of my old project. Still
need to design a logo and adjust some of the colors plus some 
some parts such as the footer and the pop
up window I would still need to adjust some of the layout.
Wondering what does this security vulnerabilities mean in 
my dependencies going to need to read more about them. 

Planning to recreate this from scratch so that I could
remember and retain how I made it using SASS and use of the BEM 
methodology of naming classes. 


#Day 15: August 18, 2019
Progress:
Today I added some of the content of the JavaScript Technical
Documentation project I'm working on.

I did some tweaks with the old project card properties. Increased
the perspective from 20rem to 40rem to make the transition flip
of the card look more natural. Still need to think of a more suitable 
color for the spiderman theme that I want to achieve. Comments would be 
highly appreciated. 

#Day 16: August 19, 2019
Progress:
Reviewed difference between var, let, and const keywords.
ES6(ES2015): difference between a block scope variable and a function scope variable.
While working on the technical documentation and reading throught some of the materials.
Studied agile scrum backlog refinement on agile. Reviewed what are 
Global function and encapsulation. Practiced git commands again for retention and familiarization.
